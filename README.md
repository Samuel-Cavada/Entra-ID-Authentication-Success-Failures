## üìå Project Objective
> Create interactive world map visualizations in Azure Sentinel Workbooks to monitor successful and failed authentication attempts in Entra ID (Azure AD). This project focuses on geolocation-based analysis for understanding login patterns and suspicious access activity.

---

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies
- **Platform:** Azure Sentinel
- **OS:** N/A
- **Tools:** Azure Workbooks, Log Analytics, PowerShell
- **Languages/Scripts:** KQL

---

## üß† Skills Gained / Focus Areas
- Built geolocation-based dashboards for authentication logs
- Differentiated between success and failure events
- Used KQL to filter and summarize by source IP and country
- Created custom visualizations to aid security monitoring

---

## üß™ Environment Setup
> Logged into Azure Portal, accessed Microsoft Sentinel, and opened the **Workbooks** section under **Threat Management**. Selected data from SignInLogs to visualize user login success and failures based on IP origin.

## üõ†Ô∏è Walkthrough
1. [Step 1: Access Workbook Tools](#step-1-access-workbook-tools)
2. [Step 2: Configure Success & Failure Queries](#step-2-configure-success--failure-queries)
3. [Step 3: Visualize by Geography](#step-3-visualize-by-geography)

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Access Workbook Tools
> - Opened Azure Sentinel  
> - Went to **Threat Management** ‚Üí **Workbooks**  
> - Clicked **Add Workbook** to begin designing the visualization  
> - Selected **Log Analytics** as the data source

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Configure Success & Failure Queries
> Sample KQL for authentication **successes**:
```kql
SigninLogs
| where ResultType == 0 and TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
| summarize count() by tostring(LocationDetails["countryOrRegion"]), IPAddress
```

> Sample KQL for authentication **failures**:
```kql
SigninLogs
| where ResultType != 0 and TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
| summarize count() by tostring(LocationDetails["countryOrRegion"]), IPAddress
```

> Adjusted queries for:
> - Filtering by user role or application
> - Custom time ranges
> - Aggregating by source IP, device, and region

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Visualize by Geography
> - Used the **Map** visualization in Workbooks  
> - Mapped IP addresses to geographic regions using `LocationDetails`  
> - Created two views: one for successful logins, one for failures  
> - Allowed filtering by user, time, and country

## üìù Outcomes and Lessons Learned
- **Technical Insight:** Login success and failure trends offer visibility into both user behavior and potential brute-force attacks.
- **Configuration Skills:** Created geolocation dashboards using Log Analytics and KQL.
- **Troubleshooting:** Refined log queries to handle null values and enhance map accuracy.
- **Takeaway:** Visualizing login data enhances understanding of authentication risks and user distribution globally.
